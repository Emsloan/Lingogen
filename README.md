# Lingogen

Lingogen is a Python application for foreign language learners that creates [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards with audio pronunciations of words and phrases in the target language.

When learning vocabularly in a new language it is helpful to hear a term's pronunciation. Self-taught language learners rarely have the privelege of speaking with native speakers and often struggle with pronunciation. Lingogen utilizes Googles text-to-speech API to generate .mp3s audio files of a word or phrase. These files are then included in each card, which are created using the fantastic [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki).

Users of Lingogen can use .txt files or manually enter word pairs to create their decks. Lingogen currently supports English, Italian, and German.


Lingogen was created and is maintained by [Elliott Sloan](github.com/Emsloan).
